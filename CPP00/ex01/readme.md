### Private vs Public in a C++ Class

In C++, a **class** is a **blueprint** for creating objects. It defines **attributes (variables)** and **methods (functions)**.

#### **Access Specifiers:**
- **`private:`** (only accessible inside the class)
  - These members **cannot** be accessed directly from outside the class.

  
- **`public:`** (accessible from outside the class)
  - These members **can** be accessed from outside using an object.
